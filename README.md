# Dotfiles

These are my versioned dotfiles based on the ideas from the book [Boost Your Git DX](https://adamchainz.gumroad.com/l/byddx)

## Home Brew

I'd really rather not have to use Home Brew (not for any particular reason ... just because), but there are three things that I have to use it for:

- git
- just
- pipx

### git

This is to get the HTML docs for git. I find these easier to read than `man` pages.

### just

Because it's awesome

### pipx

For `justpath`
